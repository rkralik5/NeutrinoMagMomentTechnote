\section{Results / Fake data studies}
[to do]: talk about the shape-only versus normalisation-only strategies for the differential versus single-bin analyses.

I think it might be a good idea to talk about this already in the analysis overview section.

I need to also discuss fake data studies. Should I talk about this now? Probably

\subsection{Counting experiment}
Single bin analysis - total numbers of signal and backgrounds predicted. Possible background corrections and its effect on the background uncertainties. 

\subsection{Binned experiment}
Plots showing delta chi2 for stats and systs separately. Plot showing the chi2 with limits. Maybe talk about using different binning and variables and the effect.

Also need to somehow quantify the various fitter settings, like different seeding values, different range of profiling. Should I talk about Feldman-Cousins? 

\subsubsection{Sensitivities and limits}
